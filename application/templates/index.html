<h2>Campaigns</h2>
  <p>
    Only Bacchus staff and approved consultants have access to the account data on this platform to manage and generate reports.
    These reports are delivered to influencers and brands for campaigns they are involved with, to better understand campaign performance.
    View the <a href="{{ url_for('render_static', page_name='privacy') }}">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="{{ url_for('render_static', page_name='tos') }}">Terms of Service</a> for more details.
    In general, data that is collected for campaigns include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Media posts and associated metrics such as impressions, likes, and reach
    </li>
    <li>
      Account Insights such as follower city and active follower count
    </li>
    <li>
      Collecting this data and storing in campaigns (collection of multiple posts) alleviates the manual sending of each media posts metrics, and automates reporting for large campaigns with hundreds of posts across dozens of accounts.   Joining the platform does not grant access to other non-partnered influencers or brands. A brand or influencer will only be able to view metrics and insights on their own account.
    </li>
  </ul>
