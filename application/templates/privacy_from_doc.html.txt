California law requires that operators of online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track signal. Some browsers have incorporated &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked. At this time we do not respond to Do Not Track signal.</span></p><p class="c15 c19"><span class="c7"></span></p><ol class="c6 lst-kix_list_2-0" start="9"><li class="c1"><span class="c2">EU Users&rsquo; Rights</span></li></ol><p class="c12 c17"><span class="c26">This section of our Privacy Policy applies to the users of our Platform in the EU.
